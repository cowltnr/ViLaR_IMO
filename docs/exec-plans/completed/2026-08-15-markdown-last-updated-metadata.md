# Markdown last-updated metadata migration

## Baseline

- Before this implementation plan was added, 37 in-scope Markdown files
  existed; only the approved design already had the timestamp.
- The current checkout is `harness/bootstrap`.

## Fixed conditions

- No production Python or ROS2 edits.
- No live runtime commands.
- Exclude `IsaacSim/`, `.git/`, `.superpowers/sdd/`, and directories named
  `__pycache__`.
- Preserve unrelated work.

## Metric and acceptance criteria

- Metric: number and paths of in-scope Markdown files with a missing or
  malformed first line.
- Acceptance: zero invalid files, focused test green, both standard scripts
  green, tracked commit scope reviewed, and untracked documents preserved.

## Progress log

- 2026-08-15 21:15 KST: execution plan created. The approved inventory command
  reported 38 currently discoverable in-scope Markdown files before this plan
  was added.
- RED result: focused contract test failed as expected, listing 36 invalid
  in-scope Markdown files.
- Batch timestamp: `2026-08-15 21:16 KST`.
- Validation results: focused contract test passed twice after the rewrite; the
  approved inventory reports 39 in-scope Markdown files.
- 2026-08-15 21:30 KST: Task 2 independently reran `bash scripts/check.sh`
  (exit 0; 17 tests passed) and `bash scripts/test_offline.sh` (exit 0; 17
  tests passed). Neither command required a sandbox-external retry.
- Post-commit `bash scripts/check.sh` in the sandbox encountered five
  LibreOffice rendering failures because `/run/user/1001/dconf/user` was
  read-only; rerunning the same command outside the sandbox passed all 17
  tests.
- Final inventory: 39 in-scope Markdown files, all with a well-formed first
  line. The `2026-08-15 21:16 KST` batch timestamp remains the exact timestamp
  used for the migration batch.
- Completion review confirmed that the timestamp rollout did not modify
  production Python or ROS2 files, the excluded trees remain excluded from the
  contract, and no live or safety-sensitive command was run.

## Decision log

- Do not stage untracked documents wholesale: their content predates or is
  unrelated to this timestamp migration, so only task-owned files and tracked
  timestamp-only changes will be committed.
- The first bulk-rewrite command was rejected by Perl because its replacement
  delimiter was omitted. It made no file changes; the corrected command using
  the required delimiter completed successfully with the recorded batch
  timestamp.
- Direct edits made outside Codex can leave an otherwise well-formed timestamp
  stale; this workflow requires Codex to update the first line with each
  Markdown edit but does not install a Git hook, daemon, watcher, or editor
  plugin.

## Acceptance completion

- [x] No in-scope Markdown file has a missing or malformed first line.
- [x] The focused contract test is green (RED evidence is recorded above).
- [x] `scripts/check.sh` and `scripts/test_offline.sh` both pass.
- [x] The final commit is limited to intentional tracked documentation and
  contract-test content; unrelated local work is preserved.
