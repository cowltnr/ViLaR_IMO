# ROS2 Topic Control Figure Design

## Objective

Create two corrected 1672×941 PNG figures using the immutable backup images as
the visual baseline:

1. the control architecture implemented by the current production code;
2. the proposed direction for safer, single-owner velocity control.

The figures must be readable as ROS2 topic-flow diagrams, preserve the approved
backup composition, and continue to use the palette and curvature derived from
`ictc_test/overview.png`.

## Mandatory LIMO asset rule

Every robot-control architecture figure in this repository must use the LIMO
image from this exact RobotLAB URL:

`https://new.robotlab.com/hubfs/LIMO%20ROS2_20231018_2-1.png`

Do not replace it with an AI-redrawn robot, a generic mobile robot, or a
different LIMO photograph. The source PNG has an alpha channel; composite its
original pixels directly so that `LIMO`, `AGILE·X`, the green light, and vehicle
number `03` remain intact.

## Visual language

- Canvas: 1672×941, warm off-white `#F7F9F8`.
- Structural stroke and arrows: neutral gray near `#666767`.
- Cloud Server: title background `#595959`, group background `#EEEEEE`.
- Perception: title background `#B8E9FF`, group background `#F0FAFF`.
- Decision: title background `#FEEFC5`, group background `#FFFAEA`.
- VLM Server: title background `#E4F0D5`, group background `#F9FCF5`.
- Control: title background `#CCD2F0`, group background `#F1F2F8`.
- TF/state feedback: cyan dotted arrow.
- Safety and verified caveats: restrained pastel red.
- Every component content box uses white `#FFFFFF` by default. A tinted
  component body is allowed only when it conveys a necessary state such as a
  warning, safety stop, or proposal, and it must use a low-saturation pastel
  derived from the nearest category color above.
- Any additional color must remain in the same pastel family as the category
  colors above and preserve dark-text contrast.
- Use rounded rectangles, approximately 18 px group radius and 12 px module
  radius, matching the curvature of `overview.png`.
- Preserve the backup relationship between title and component boxes: a title
  uses a separate rounded tab attached to or slightly overlapping the category
  group boundary, and white component boxes remain visibly inset in the tinted
  group background.
- Title tabs use the exact category title color, category bodies use the exact
  matching background color, and nested functional cards remain white.
- A nested card such as `VLM Advisory` may use the VLM title color as its
  header accent while retaining the required white component body. The VLM
  body color `#F9FCF5` is required only when a standalone `VLM Server` category
  group is drawn; a header accent alone does not turn a nested card into that
  category group.
- Typography uses one reproducible sans-serif family matching the backup
  visual weight: `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf` for body,
  topic, endpoint, and annotation text, and
  `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf` for the main title,
  category titles, component titles, ROS role badges, and interface pills.
- Use this shared 1672×941 type scale in both figures: 34 px main title, 18 px
  category and principal component titles, 15 px normal interface/body text,
  and 13 px compact topic rows, flow labels, and secondary notes. A smaller
  size is allowed only to fit an exact code identifier inside its existing
  backup-aligned box; never condense, stretch, italicize, or mix font families.
- Preserve the backup hierarchy: bold titles, regular descriptive text, bold
  `SUB`/`PUB`/`HTTP`/`TF` badges, and compact bold arrow-label pills.
- Use straight or orthogonal arrows. Every arrow must start and end at a named
  producer, consumer, or interface pill.
- Arrow labels sit in white rounded pills and must not overlap lines, boxes, or
  other text.
- Multiprocessing appears only as a small note under the ROS2 sensor subscriber.

## Current implementation content

The production-code figure shows these verified ROS2 interfaces:

- Sensor subscriptions: `/sim/camera/color/image_raw`, `/sim/scan`, `/sim/odom`.
- Intent subscription: `/user_intent_goal`.
- Decision outputs: `/selected_route`, `/selected_route_goal`,
  `/navigation_stop`.
- Controller subscriptions: `/selected_route`, `/selected_route_goal`,
  `/navigation_stop`.
- Controller pose lookup: TF `odom → base_link`.
- Controller output: `/sim/cmd_vel` with `geometry_msgs/Twist`.

HTTP paths from `IETF125.png` and production code are shown separately:
`GET /video`, `GET /odometry`, `GET /lidar`, `POST /select_wp`, and
`POST /inference`.

The figure must preserve the verified current limitations: route-selection
stop at 6.0 m, emergency stop at 1.2 m, incomplete intent-state handoff,
duplicate route publication after VLM handling, and no code-level arbitration
between Point Follower and Pure Pursuit.

## Proposed-direction content

The proposed figure keeps the existing public topic names and introduces no
unverified topic names. It shows:

- validated route and stop ownership;
- VLM output used as advisory input to deterministic validation;
- `/navigation_stop` priority;
- exclusive controller selection;
- internal velocity proposals rather than direct controller publication;
- Command Arbitration as the sole `/sim/cmd_vel` publisher;
- state/health validation and safe stop on fault or stale state.

Every proposed component is labeled `TARGET` so it cannot be mistaken for
current production behavior.

## Backup rule for this redesign

Before replacing the active figures, preserve the earliest identifiable image
generated on 2026-08-15. Filesystem evidence identifies the 18:11:07 image as
the earliest candidate available in the generation cache.

The following files are immutable visual baselines and must never be edited or
overwritten:

- `ictc_test/backup/2026-08-15_first_generated_robot_motion_control.png`
- `ictc_test/backup/2026-08-15_first_generated_robot_motion_control_future.png`

The active image outputs are replaced:

- `ictc_test/robot_motion_control_current.png`
- `ictc_test/robot_motion_control_future.png`

The companion explanation is updated after both images are finalized:

- `ictc_test/robot_motion_control_architecture_explanation.txt`

The explanation must describe each PNG separately in plain language, identify
current behavior versus proposed behavior, list the exact ROS2 topics and HTTP
endpoints shown, explain the arrow directions, and record verified code
limitations. It must not describe a box or connection that is absent from the
corresponding final PNG.

## Approved topology corrections

The active figures retain the 1672×941 baseline composition, rounded boxes,
exact category palette above, and restrained orthogonal arrows of the
immutable backups.
They correct the topology instead of painting over individual pixels.

### Current figure

- Fused detections and Camera–2D LiDAR distance flow to the edge safety and
  route-decision logic, not to `IntentDecisionNode`.
- `IntentDecisionNode` receives only `/user_intent_goal` and publishes
  `/selected_route` and `/intent_feedback`.
- The edge decision sends `POST /select_wp` to the VLM server and receives the
  selected waypoint and reason as the response.
- Logging flows from edge inference through `POST /inference` to the JSON and
  image logging server. The logging server does not feed the safety decision.
- The current controller subscribes to `/selected_route`,
  `/selected_route_goal`, and `/navigation_stop`, performs TF
  `odom → base_link`, and publishes `/sim/cmd_vel` directly to the robot.
- Point Follower and Pure Pursuit remain alternative direct publishers, with
  an explicit operational constraint that only one may run.

### Proposed figure

- A compact current baseline remains visible with the actual direct
  `/sim/cmd_vel` path to the robot.
- ROS2 route and stop topics point toward the subscribing controller rather
  than away from it.
- The target path is visually separate: controller velocity proposal →
  Command Arbitration → `/sim/cmd_vel` → robot.
- Command Arbitration, Controller Manager, deterministic Safety Supervisor,
  State & Health Monitor, and Fallback Safe Stop are all explicitly marked
  `TARGET` or `PROPOSED`.
- No new public ROS2 topic name is invented. Internal velocity proposals and
  health/fault signals are conceptual internal interfaces.

## Layout and verification acceptance criteria

- No text, topic badge, box, or arrow overlaps another text element.
- No arrow crosses a group title tab or terminates in empty space.
- Each arrow points from producer to consumer; bidirectional HTTP interaction
  uses two separately directed paths.
- Current and proposed paths use visibly distinct line styles and a legend.
- The exact RobotLAB LIMO PNG is composited without redrawing or recoloring.
- Both active outputs are 1672×941 PNG files and are visually inspected at
  original resolution.
- `robot_motion_control_architecture_explanation.txt` matches the final boxes,
  labels, arrows, current caveats, and proposed-only components in both PNGs.
- The two backup SHA-256 values remain unchanged after generation.
- Verification is static and offline only; no ROS2, simulator, Flask, Ollama,
  or robot process is started.
